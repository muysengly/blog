## Components

Each markdown page is converted into a Vue component, which means you can use Vue syntax in Markdown:

{{ 1 + 1 }}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

<ul>
  <li v-for="i in 3">{{ i }}</li>
</ul>

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

You can also create and import your own components.

<MyComponent />

<script setup>
import { defineComponent, h, ref } from 'vue';

const MyComponent = defineComponent({
  setup() {
    const input = ref('Hello world!');
    const onInput = (e) => {
      input.value = e.target.value;
    };

    return () => [
      h('p', [
        h('span','Input: '),
        h('input', {
          value: input.value,
          onInput,
        }),
      ]),
      h('p', [h('span','Output: '), input.value]),
    ];
  },
});
</script>
