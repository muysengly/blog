<template><div><p><strong>Python</strong> is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This <strong>tutorial</strong> gives enough understanding on <strong>Python programming</strong> language.</p>
<h2 id="why-to-learn-python" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-to-learn-python"><span>Why to Learn Python?</span></a></h2>
<p><strong>Python</strong> is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
<p><strong>Python</strong> is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python is Interpreted</strong> − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
<li><strong>Python is Interactive</strong> − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
<li><strong>Python is Object-Oriented</strong> − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
<li><strong>Python is a Beginner's Language</strong> − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="characteristics-of-python" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#characteristics-of-python"><span>Characteristics of Python</span></a></h2>
<p>Following are important characteristics of <strong>Python Programming</strong> −</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
<li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
<li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
<li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
<li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I'm going to give you a small conventional Python Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy-to-learn</strong> − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Easy-to-read</strong> − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
<li><strong>Easy-to-maintain</strong> − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
<li><strong>A broad standard library</strong> − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Mode</strong> − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
<li><strong>Portable</strong> − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Extendable</strong> − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Databases</strong> − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
<li><strong>GUI Programming</strong> − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable</strong> − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="audience" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#audience"><span>Audience</span></a></h2>
<p>This <strong>Python tutorial</strong> is designed for software programmers who need to learn Python programming language from scratch.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prerequisites"><span>Prerequisites</span></a></h2>
<p>You should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the programming languages is a plus.</p>
