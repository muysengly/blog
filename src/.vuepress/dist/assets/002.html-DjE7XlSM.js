This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li><li><strong>Easy-to-read</strong> − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li><li><strong>Easy-to-maintain</strong> − Python&#39;s source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li><li><strong>A broad standard library</strong> − Python&#39;s bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li><li><strong>Interactive Mode</strong> − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li><li><strong>Portable</strong> − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li><li><strong>Extendable</strong> − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li><li><strong>Databases</strong> − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li><li><strong>GUI Programming</strong> − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li><li><strong>Scalable</strong> − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li></ul><p>Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below −</p><ul><li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li><li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li><li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li><li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li><li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li></ul>',12)]))}const c=t(i,[["render",r],["__file","002.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/classes/course_001/002.html","title":" 2.
