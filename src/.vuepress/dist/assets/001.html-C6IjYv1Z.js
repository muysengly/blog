Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p><p><strong>Python</strong> is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:</p><ul><li><strong>Python is Interpreted</strong> − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li><li><strong>Python is Interactive</strong> − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li><li><strong>Python is Object-Oriented</strong> − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li><li><strong>Python is a Beginner&#39;s Language</strong> − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li></ul><h2 id="characteristics-of-python" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#characteristics-of-python"><span>Characteristics of Python</span></a></h2><p>Following are important characteristics of <strong>Python Programming</strong> −</p><ul><li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li><li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li><li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li><li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li><li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li></ul><h2 id="hello-world-using-python" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hello-world-using-python"><span>Hello World using Python.</span></a></h2><p>Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I&#39;m going to give you a small conventional Python Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.</p><div class="language-python line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="shiki" data-ext="python" data-title="python" style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34;"><pre class="shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#0184BC;--shiki-dark:#56B6C2;">print</span><span style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF;">(</span><span style="--shiki-light:#50A14F;--shiki-dark:#98C379;">&quot;Hello, Python!&quot;</span><span style="--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF;">)</span><span style="--shiki-light:#000000;--shiki-dark:#FFFFFF;">;</span></span></code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true" style="counter-reset:line-number 0;"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><h2 id="applications-of-python" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#applications-of-python"><span>Applications of Python</span></a></h2><p>As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I&#39;m going to list few of them here:</p><ul><li><strong>Easy-to-learn</strong> − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li><li><strong>Easy-to-read</strong> − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li><li><strong>Easy-to-maintain</strong> − Python&#39;s source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li><li><strong>A broad standard library</strong> − Python&#39;s bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li><li><strong>Interactive Mode</strong> − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li><li><strong>Portable</strong> − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li><li><strong>Extendable</strong> − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li><li><strong>Databases</strong> − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li><li><strong>GUI Programming</strong> − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li><li><strong>Scalable</strong> − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li></ul><h2 id="audience" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#audience"><span>Audience</span></a></h2><p>This <strong>Python tutorial</strong> is designed for software programmers who need to learn Python programming language from scratch.</p><h2 id="prerequisites" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prerequisites"><span>Prerequisites</span></a></h2><p>You should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies.
