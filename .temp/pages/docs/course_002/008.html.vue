<template><div><p>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</p>
<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement −</p>

<p>Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>

<p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
<p>Python supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>
<p>Let us go through the loop control statements briefly</p>
